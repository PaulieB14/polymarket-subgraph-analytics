## Dashboard Integration

### Enhanced Data Transformation with Human-Readable Names and Orderbook Data

**NEW**: With the Polymarket Names subgraph and the advanced Orderbook & Market Microstructure subgraph, you can now build comprehensive trading dashboards with human-readable market titles and real-time market depth data!

#### Advanced Market Card with Orderbook Data
```javascript
// Enhanced market data transformation with names and orderbook depth
function formatAdvancedMarketData(rawMarket, marketNames, orderbookData) {
  // Find matching market name from Names subgraph
  const marketName = marketNames.find(m => 
    m.questionID.toLowerCase() === rawMarket.conditions[0].toLowerCase()
  );
  
  // Find matching orderbook data
  const orderbook = orderbookData.find(ob => 
    ob.marketId === rawMarket.conditions[0]
  );
  
  return {
    id: rawMarket.id,
    volume: formatCurrency(rawMarket.scaledCollateralVolume),
    probability: formatProbability(rawMarket.outcomeTokenPrices),
    trades: rawMarket.tradesQuantity,
    status: getMarketStatus(rawMarket),
    title: marketName?.question || "Market title not found",
    questionID: rawMarket.conditions[0],
    // New orderbook metrics
    spread: orderbook?.currentSpread || "N/A",
    spreadPercentage: orderbook?.currentSpreadPercentage || "N/A",
    bidDepth: orderbook?.totalBidDepth || "0",
    askDepth: orderbook?.totalAskDepth || "0",
    lastTradePrice: orderbook?.lastTradePrice || "N/A"
  };
}

// Multi-subgraph query for comprehensive market data
const comprehensiveMarketQuery = `
  query GetCompleteMarketData {
    # From Polymarket Main subgraph
    fixedProductMarketMakers(first: 10, orderBy: scaledCollateralVolume, orderDirection: desc) {
      id
      conditions
      scaledCollateralVolume
      outcomeTokenPrices
      tradesQuantity
    }
  }
`;

const orderbookQuery = `
  query GetOrderbookData($marketIds: [String!]) {
    orderBooks(where: { marketId_in: $marketIds }) {
      id
      marketId
      totalBidDepth
      totalAskDepth
      bidDepthLevels
      askDepthLevels
      lastUpdate
    }
    spreads(where: { marketId_in: $marketIds }) {
      id
      marketId
      currentSpread
      currentSpreadPercentage
      avgSpread
      lastUpdate
    }
    orderFills(
      where: { marketId_in: $marketIds }
      orderBy: timestamp
      orderDirection: desc
      first: 1
    ) {
      marketId
      price
      timestamp
    }
  }
`;

const namesQuery = `
  query GetMarketNames($questionIDs: [Bytes!]) {
    markets(where: { questionID_in: $questionIDs }) {
      questionID
      question
      creator
      timestamp
    }
  }
`;
```

### Key Benefits of the Advanced Orderbook Subgraph Integration

- **Real-time Market Depth**: Monitor bid-ask depth and liquidity in real-time
- **Market Microstructure Analysis**: Advanced metrics for spread analysis and order flow
- **Trading Strategy Insights**: Price impact analysis and liquidity scoring
- **Professional Trading Tools**: Order flow imbalance detection and market efficiency metrics
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Complete market picture with names, prices, and depth data
